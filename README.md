# Blockphase
Blockphase is a software for accurate genotype calling and haplotype phasing. Our newly designed approach constructed two steps: first, we built a haplotype graph(HG) by randomly dividing the haplotypes into blocks with disjoint contiguous markers, treat the same distinct haplotypes as one which is the key feature of reducing redundancies states. Then, we used backward sampling to update one individual by its genotype likelihood. 

# Building Blockphase
Blockphase requires the Boost C++ library, please add them to your enviroment path:

export PATH=/path/to/boost/include:$PATH

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/boost/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

git clone https://github.com/songli-bgi/Blockphase.git

Get in to the "Blcokphase" directory. 

cd Blockphase

If you had beed set up the boost library path, you can type "make" in your command line

make

# Usage
You can get the help information by:

./blockphase -h/--help 

examples:

./blockphase -i $infile -o $outfile 

./blockphase -i $infile -o $outfile -b 5 -c 15 -s 20

# Tips for using Blcokphase
-s --states: it will control the maximum states in HMM, the computation time and memory usage are depended on it. The accuracy of genotyping and phasing are influence by this parameter. In my exprience, when the sample size < 300, -s 15 or 20 is enough for a very good result. However, the sample size > 1000, -s 50 or 100 will get more accuary result. The scale of impact of "-s" parameter on genotype calling and haplotype phasing is different, higher impact on haplotype phaisng and lower on genotype calling. More larger "-s" is set, more accuary result will get, and the accuracy of genotype calling is not association with "-s".
